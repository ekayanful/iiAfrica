Take note that this instructions assumes you know unix terminal commands, and that you have python installed on your system.

1. ensure that your spreadsheet file from insendi is in the same folder as the python script and class list file.
2. open a terminal and move into the directory where you have files saved.
3. if you are not runing anaconda, please run this in the terminal "pip install -r requirement.txt" without the quotation of course :) .
4. now run in the terminal "python class_analytics.py [insendi_file] [class_list_file]" without the square brackets and quotation.
5. choose y or n when asked if you want to extract sections or all class analytics
6. when you type in y, you will be asked to specify the days you want to extract separated by comma (for example 1,5 means day 1 to day 5. 1,1 means extract for only day 1) 
7. sit back and enjoy :) .
